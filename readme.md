# 3rd Person Platform: Advanced Game Design Project 1

Game developed for the Advanced Game Design (INB281) class at QUT (Queensland University of Technology).

### Description:

Take some time to experiment with various aspects of Unity 3D (e.g. controls, window layout, placing and moving objects). Examine the provided game environment and assets carefully. Plan and design a conceptual model of the game you wish to make (concept art, pseudo code etc). Expand upon the provided game environment, creating an interesting 3rd Person Platformer game. This game should contain a passage of gameplay that uses but is not limited to the following tools, objects and assets:
- Terrain and associated terrain tools
- Simple 3D Game Objects (cubes, spheres, capsules, free objects from the Asset Store etc)
-  Lights and Audio Sources
- A player character controlled in 3rd person (provided)
- One or more enemy turret NPCs (provided)

##### Deliverable:
At the end of this activity it is expected that you have experimented with the software and added to the game package so that your version of the game has at least the following elements:
- A Level Design that displays a goal (i.e. objective or purpose in the game) and loss condition (i.e. losing the game through some means)
- Two ends states:
    - A goal (i.e. objective or purpose in the game) as described in the level design
    - A loss condition (i.e. how the player loses the game)

##### Suggestions (non-deliverable but useful):

    Triggers and Colliders
        Have a look at collisions and triggers; many actions within games require a reaction to a certain event, this could be useful for the deliverables.

    Particles
        Investigate how you can turn Particle Systems (GameObject->Particle Systems) into interesting environmental effects (e.g. fire, snow, dust, projectile trails, explosion   

    Obstacle Materials
        Cubes and boxes can look pretty bland, how about trying to add your own materials?

    Sound
        A motion seems to have no impact without a sound, how about trying to implement sounds with actions in your game?

    Basic Tweaking
        Adjust the settings of the player, turret and projectile to your liking.

    Taking Damage
        The player has a total amount of health, and loses parts per hit taken by the turret

    Environment Design
        Trekking through a jungle or desert plain? How about a maze full of animated platforms and jumping puzzles? Check out the Asset Store (Window->Asset Store) for level design ideas.

    Score / Objectives / Collectibles
        Why not making something that can be collected on the way to your winning condition? You could even increment a score based on these.
